# RandForest-TermDeposit-Subscriptions-Classifier
This is a repository for a data-driven approach to predict the term deposit subscriptions performed on a Portuguese Banking dataset. The ability to predict individuals who will subscribe to a term deposit would be of interest to those companies which require this criterion to identify target recipients. This model can be employed by the financial institution bank, our primary stakeholder, to increase their net revenue. Market Executives may wish to utilize this model to craft the marketing campaign to meet bank targets carefully. The Customer Service Team will play an essential part in activating and delivering the marketing campaign.
